PyMD4C Changelog
================

PyMD4C version numbers track MD4C version numbers:

    Major.Minor.Patch.PyMD4C

* Major, minor, and patch versions match the version of MD4C that PyMD4C is
  based on.
* The final number is the PyMD4C version, which will start at zero for each
  MD4C version and be incremented each time there is a new PyMD4C release for
  the same version of MD4C.
